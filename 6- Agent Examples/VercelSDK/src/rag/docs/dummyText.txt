Great Fire of London (1666) 

In the early hours of Sunday, 2 September 1666, fire broke out in the City of London at a bakery owned by Thomas Farriner (also spelled Farynor) on Pudding Lane. A strong easterly wind drove sparks across a dense warren of timber-framed houses whose upper stories jutted over narrow streets. London had suffered a long, dry summer, so beams and shingles were tinder-dry; within hours, the blaze leapt from roof to roof and street to street. Standard firefighting methods—passing buckets, dousing with water, and pulling down adjoining buildings with firehooks to create firebreaks—were attempted but proved inadequate. The Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Bloodworth, hesitated to authorize widespread demolition, fearing legal and financial liability for destroying private property, and by the time decisive measures were taken the fire’s momentum was formidable.

As the wind carried flames westward, iconic civic buildings fell: the Royal Exchange, the Guildhall, and scores of livery company halls. On 4 September, the medieval St Paul’s Cathedral—then under repair and wreathed in scaffolding—caught fire; lead from its roof reportedly ran in rivers, and the great church collapsed. Observers such as Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn recorded scenes of panic and flight as families loaded carts and boats with their belongings, while rumors and xenophobic scapegoating sparked attacks on foreigners. King Charles II and his brother James, Duke of York, took an active role, ordering soldiers to assist firefighters and finally deploying gunpowder to blow up houses ahead of the flames. These explosive firebreaks, combined with a shift in the wind and the natural exhaustion of burnable fuel, helped bring the conflagration under control by Wednesday, 5 September.

The scale of destruction was immense. Contemporary tallies estimated that some 13,200 houses were destroyed along with 87 parish churches, St Paul’s Cathedral, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, the Guildhall, and other landmarks; most of the City within the old Roman walls was reduced to ash. Between 70,000 and 100,000 people—out of a population of around 80,000 within the City—were displaced. Officially recorded deaths were few, but the real human toll is uncertain; records are incomplete, and poor or undocumented residents may not have been counted. The economic shock was severe but temporary: London remained England’s commercial heart, and trade resumed quickly in temporary markets and sheds.

Rebuilding began almost immediately. Visionaries including Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke drew grand plans to remake the City with wide boulevards and regular grids, but property rights and the urgency to rebuild meant most medieval street patterns persisted. Parliament’s Rebuilding Act of 1667 and subsequent measures imposed stricter building regulations: houses were to be constructed of brick or stone with thicker party walls, jettied timber fronts were banned, and streets were widened to reduce the risk of fire spreading. A special Fire Court expedited disputes between landlords and tenants so that reconstruction could proceed without years of litigation. St Paul’s Cathedral was entirely redesigned by Wren in the classical style and completed in 1710, while dozens of parish churches rose anew with innovative spires and domes that still define the City’s skyline.

The catastrophe also accelerated the development of property insurance. Entrepreneurs such as Nicholas Barbon established fire insurance offices that not only underwrote buildings but also created private fire brigades, whose badges or fire marks were affixed to insured structures. Public infrastructure improved over time with better water supplies and organized firefighting, and the memory of the disaster lived on in civic ritual and stone. The Monument—designed by Wren and Hooke and completed in 1677—stands 202 feet high, exactly the distance from its base to the site of Farriner’s bakery, a vertical measure meant as a literal reminder of the fire’s origin. Inscriptions commemorate both the destruction and the City’s recovery, though some early versions carried polemical claims later removed.

Debate continues among historians about the fire’s indirect effects. A popular belief that the blaze ended the plague of 1665–66 overstates the case: mortality had declined before the fire, and the epidemic had been far worse in suburban parishes outside the City’s walls, which largely escaped the flames. Nevertheless, the removal of crowded, insanitary housing in the core and the subsequent building regulations likely improved urban health and reduced future fire risk. The episode also highlighted the tensions between private rights and public safety—whether officials should be empowered to destroy property in an emergency—and it prompted clearer legal frameworks for prompt action. Blame for the disaster circulated widely at the time: foreigners and Catholics were accused; a French watchmaker, Robert Hubert, falsely confessed and was executed, though his story was quickly doubted. Modern scholarship attributes the fire to material conditions—tight streets, wooden structures, wind, and drought—more than to sabotage or conspiracy.

By the 1670s, the rebuilt City mixed old alignments with new materials. Warehouses and churches rose in brick and Portland stone; merchants returned to their wharves on the Thames; and financial life consolidated around the restored Royal Exchange and coffeehouses that would incubate institutions such as the London Stock Exchange and Lloyd’s. The Great Fire thus serves as a case study in urban risk, governance, and resilience: it began with a single spark in a vulnerable environment, was magnified by hesitation and weather, and ended with reforms that reshaped a global capital. Its lessons—about preparedness, decisive authority, building codes, and post‑disaster reconstruction—remain relevant to modern cities facing fire, earthquake, or flood.
