## Product - Feature Specifications

### Feature Development Process

Feature lifecycle:
1. Discovery: User research and market analysis
2. Ideation: Brainstorming and concept development
3. Specification: Detailed feature requirements
4. Design: UI/UX mockups and prototypes
5. Development: Engineering implementation
6. Testing: QA and user acceptance testing
7. Launch: Gradual rollout and monitoring
8. Iteration: Post-launch improvements based on feedback

Feature prioritization framework:
- Impact: How many users benefit?
- Effort: Development complexity and time
- Strategic alignment: Supports company goals?
- User demand: Request frequency and urgency

### User Stories Format

User stories follow this structure:
"As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"

Acceptance criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected outcome]

Example user story:
"As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it."

Acceptance criteria:
- Given I am on the login page
- When I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email
- Then I receive a password reset email within 5 minutes
- And the reset link is valid for 24 hours
- And I can create a new password that meets security requirements

### Feature Requirements Template

Each feature specification includes:
- Overview: High-level description
- Goals: What problem does this solve?
- User personas: Who is this for?
- User flows: Step-by-step user journey
- Functional requirements: What the feature must do
- Non-functional requirements: Performance, security, etc.
- Edge cases: Error handling and boundary conditions
- Success metrics: How we measure success

### Product Roadmap

Roadmap structure:
- Q1: Features planned for next quarter
- Q2: Features planned for following quarter
- Future: Ideas and concepts for later consideration

Roadmap categories:
- Must have: Critical features for business goals
- Should have: Important but not critical
- Nice to have: Enhancements if time permits
- Won't have: Explicitly out of scope

Current quarter priorities:
1. Enhanced search functionality
2. Mobile app improvements
3. Advanced analytics dashboard
4. Integration with third-party services
5. Performance optimizations

### User Experience Principles

Core UX principles:
- Simplicity: Minimize cognitive load
- Consistency: Familiar patterns across features
- Feedback: Clear responses to user actions
- Error prevention: Design to prevent mistakes
- Accessibility: Usable by everyone

User experience goals:
- Task completion rate > 90%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Time to complete primary task < 2 minutes
- Error rate < 2%
- Support ticket reduction by 30%

### A/B Testing Process

A/B testing workflow:
1. Formulate hypothesis
2. Design variations (A and B)
3. Define success metrics
4. Run test with sufficient sample size
5. Analyze results statistically
6. Implement winning variation
7. Document learnings

Testing criteria:
- Minimum sample size: 1000 users per variation
- Test duration: Minimum 2 weeks
- Statistical significance: 95% confidence level
- Monitor for negative impacts on other metrics
