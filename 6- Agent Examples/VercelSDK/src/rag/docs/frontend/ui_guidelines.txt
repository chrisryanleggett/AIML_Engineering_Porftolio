## Frontend - UI/UX Guidelines

### Design System

Our design system is built on:
- Color palette: Primary blue (#0066CC), Secondary gray (#666666), Success green (#00AA44), Error red (#CC0000)
- Typography: System font stack (San Francisco, Segoe UI, Roboto)
- Spacing: 8px base unit (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48px)
- Border radius: 4px for buttons, 8px for cards, 16px for modals

Component library:
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Storybook for component documentation
- All components are accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)

### Responsive Design

Breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px
- Large desktop: > 1440px

Layout principles:
- Mobile-first: Design for mobile, enhance for larger screens
- Flexible grids: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Fluid typography: Use rem units with clamp()
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements

### Accessibility Standards

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements:
- Color contrast: Minimum 4.5:1 for text
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible
- Screen readers: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Focus indicators: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
- Alt text: Descriptive alt text for all images

Accessibility checklist:
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Forms have proper labels
- [ ] Error messages are announced to screen readers
- [ ] Color is not the only indicator of state
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Page has proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)

### Component Patterns

Reusable component patterns:
- Button: Primary, secondary, tertiary variants
- Input: Text, email, password, textarea with validation
- Card: Container for related content
- Modal: Overlay dialogs with backdrop
- Dropdown: Select menus and custom dropdowns
- Toast: Temporary notification messages

Component props:
- Always use TypeScript interfaces
- Provide default values where appropriate
- Document all props in JSDoc
- Use composition over configuration

### State Management

State management approach:
- Local state: useState for component-specific state
- Shared state: Context API for app-wide state
- Server state: React Query for API data
- Form state: React Hook Form for form management

State management principles:
- Keep state as local as possible
- Lift state up only when necessary
- Use reducers for complex state logic
- Avoid prop drilling (use Context)
- Normalize nested data structures

### Performance Optimization

Frontend performance targets:
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5 seconds
- Time to Interactive: < 3 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1

Optimization techniques:
- Code splitting: Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Image optimization: Use WebP format, lazy loading
- Bundle optimization: Tree shaking, minification
- Memoization: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Virtual scrolling: For long lists
