It was fine-tuned on a task called **Blended Skill Talk (BST)**, which combines three different conversational skills: showing unique personality, using prior knowledge, and displaying empathy. The researchers built variants with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models and made their models and code publicly available."
