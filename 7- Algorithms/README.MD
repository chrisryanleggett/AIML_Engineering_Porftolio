# Advanced Algorithms

This portfolio section showcases applied algorithm examples implementing **greedy**, **divide & conquer**, and **dynamic programming** algorithms.

## Features of the algorithm directory

- **Brute force and naive implementations** alongside refined solutions
- **Elaborate problem solving techniques** demonstrating step-by-step algorithmic thinking
- **Optimization techniques** to improve runtime, complexity, and data structures/engineering approaches

## Examples

- greedyChange.py - A script that uses a greedy algorithm approach to find the minimum number of US coins and bills needed to make change. The program prompts for a dollar amount, validates input, and returns the least number of bills and coins needed to exchange the amount in US currency.  This greedy approach can be applied to other optimization problems where making optimal local choices leads to a global optimum, such as **resource allocation** or **scheduling challenges**.
