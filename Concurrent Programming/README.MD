# Concurrent Programming Utilities

## Overview

Demonstrates multi-threaded programming concepts for maximizing CPU utilization across multiple cores and processors.

## Key Concepts

- **Threading**: Independent execution paths that run in parallel
- **Synchronization**: Managing shared resources when threads converge
- **Scheduling**: OS-level management of thread execution across cores
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Optimization across registers, caches, and storage

## Use Cases

- AI/ML processing
- Audio/video encoding
- Signal processing
- Asynchronous user interactions

## Implementation Focus

- Independent data processing across threads
- Cache-aware memory access patterns
- Minimizing thread blocking/waiting
- Efficient synchronization primitives

### Application Includes List

- Authentication system

## ToDos
